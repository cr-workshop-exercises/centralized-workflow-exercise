#### Gulash instructions

# Ingredients
1 kg/2 lb beef chuck , cut in 3.5cm / 1.5" cubes
1 3/4 tsp cooking salt / kosher salt
1 tsp black pepper
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 tbsp/ 30g unsalted butter
2 brown onions , cut into 1cm / 1/2" squares
5 garlic cloves , finely minced
2 capsicum/bell peppers (1 red + 1 yellow), cut into 2 cm / 0.8" squares
2 tomatoes , cut into 8 wedges then in half
1/4 cup Hungarian-style paprika (sub ordinary paprika)
1 tsp caraway seeds , optional
1 bay leaf
1 litre / 4 cups beef stock/broth , low-sodium
2 carrots , peeled, cut in quarters lengthwise then into 1cm / 0.4" pieces
2 potatoes , cut into 1.2cm / 1/2" cubes
1 tbsp finely chopped parsley , optional garnish

# Preparation 

- Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan), though you can use your slow cooker or stove instead (oven easiest! Note 4).
- Season beef – Toss the beef with half the salt and pepper.
- Cook onion – Heat the oil and melt the butter in a large oven-proof dutch oven over high heat. Cook onion for 6 minutes until the edges are light golden.
- Cook beef – Add the beef and stir until the outside changes from red to brown, about 2 minutes. It won't go golden brown, it's not supposed to.
- Add vegetables – Add garlic, capsicum and tomato. Stir for 3 minutes – the tomato will mostly breakdown.
- Add paprika, caraway and bay leaf. Stir for 30 seconds.
- Slow cook – Add beef stock, stir, bring to simmer. Cover with a lid and transfer to the oven for 1 1/2 hours.
- Add potato – The beef should be pretty tender but not quite "fall-apart". Stir in carrot and potatoes. Return to oven, covered, for another 30 minutes. Beef should now be "fall-apart" – if not, return to the oven for 10 minutes at a time.
- Serve – Ladle goulash into bowls and sprinkle with parsley. Eat as is, with optional bread for dunking! (Pictured with cheese bread)
