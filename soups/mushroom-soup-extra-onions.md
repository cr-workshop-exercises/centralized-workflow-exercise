# Mushroom soup with extra onions

## Ingredients
- 6 tablespoons salted butter
- 4 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 1 1/4 cups dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc
- 3 cloves garlic minced or grated
- 2 cups cremini or wild mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 6-8 cups vegetable broth
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce (or soy sauce)
- 2 bay leaves
- salt and black pepper
- 1/2 cup cream

## Instructions
Melt together the butter, onions, and honey in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until softened, about 10 minutes. 
At this point, you want to slowly add 3/4 cup of the wine, 1/4 cup at a time, until the wine cooks into the onions. 
Continue to cook another 10-15 minutes until you've used the 3/4 cup of wine and the onions are deeply caramelized.
Add the garlic, mushrooms, thyme, and sage. Season with salt and pepper, cook another 3-4 minutes. 
Add the remaining 1/2 cup wine, the broth, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. 
Increase the heat to medium-high and return the soup to a simmer, simmer 10 minutes, then stir in the cream and cook another 5-10 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and discard. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
