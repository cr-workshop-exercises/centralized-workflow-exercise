# Garlic bread

## Ingredients

- 1 baguette (approx. 400g/14oz)
- 150g/5½oz salted butter, at room temperature
- 3–4 large garlic cloves (approx. 20g/¾oz), very finely chopped
- 2 tbsp grated Parmesan or pecorino (optional)
- 2 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

- Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5 or an air fryer to 180C. Use a bread knife to cut through the baguette every 2cm/¾in, leaving the slices attached at the base so the baguette stays in once piece.

- In a bowl, mix together the butter, garlic, Parmesan (if using) and parsley with a little freshly ground black pepper.

- Spread about 1 tsp of the garlic butter between each slice of the baguette, until all the mixture is finished.

- To cook in an oven, place the bread on a baking tray and cook on the middle shelf for 15–20 minutes or until the butter has melted and the middle of the bread is piping hot. To cook in an air fryer, cut the baguette into lengths that will fit into your air fryer, if necessary, then bake in a single layer for around 10–14 minutes.

- Serve straight away or, if you need to cook in batches, wrap in kitchen foil to keep warm.
