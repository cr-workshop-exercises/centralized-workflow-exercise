# Traditional toad in the hole

No toads are needed for this recipe!

## Ingredients

- 115g plain flour
- large pinch of salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- 4 large free-range eggs
- 300ml milk
- 2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves
- 8 good quality pork, beef or vegetarian sausages
- 2 tbsp/30g Dijon mustard
- 2 tbsp/30g of beef dripping or white vegetable fat for vegetarians
- knob of butter, to serve



- To make the batter, sift the flour into a large bowl. Add the salt and pepper.

- Make a well in the centre of the flour and crack in the eggs. Using a wooden spoon, gradually beat the eggs into the flour then slowly beat in the milk until the batter is the consistency of double cream.

- Strain and push any remaining lumps through a sieve. Stir in the thyme. Cover and leave to stand for 30 minutes, or ideally 3-4 hours.

- Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.

- Heat a large non-stick pan and cook the sausages over a medium heat until golden-brown all over. (If you do not have a non-stick pan add a little oil.) Turn off the heat and brush the sausages with the mustard. Set aside.

- Place the dripping or white vegetable fat into an ovenproof dish and heat in the oven for five minutes or until the dripping is hot and hazy.

- Add the sausages to the hot dish and pour in the batter. Immediately return the dish to the oven and cook for 35-40 minutes until well-risen and golden-brown.

- Serve seasoned with black pepper and a large knob of butter.
